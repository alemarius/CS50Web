        Etymology
    </h2>
    <p>
        The taxon 'Dinosauria' was formally named in 1841 by paleontologist
        Sir Richard Owen, who used it to refer to the "distinct tribe or sub-order
        of Saurian Reptiles" that were then being recognized in England and around
        the world.[15] The term is derived from Ancient Greek δεινός (deinos),
        meaning 'terrible, potent or fearfully great', and σαῦρος (sauros), meaning
        'lizard or reptile'.[15][16] Though the taxonomic name has often been
        interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome
        characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.[17]
        <br><br>
        Other prehistoric animals, including pterosaurs, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs,
        plesiosaurs, and Dimetrodon, while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs,
        are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.[18] Pterosaurs are distantly
        related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade Ornithodira. The other groups
        mentioned are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of Sauropsida (the
        reptile and bird clade), with the exception of Dimetrodon (which is a synapsid).

        Definition
    </h2>
    <p>
        Under phylogenetic nomenclature, dinosaurs are usually defined as the group
        consisting of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Triceratops and
        Neornithes, and all its descendants.[19] It has also been suggested that
        Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon,
        because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he
        recognized the Dinosauria.[20] Both definitions result in the same set of
        animals being defined as dinosaurs: "Dinosauria = Ornithischia + Saurischia",
        encompassing ankylosaurians (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), stegosaurians
        (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), ceratopsians (herbivorous quadrupeds with
        horns and frills), ornithopods (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including
        "duck-bills"), theropods (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and sauropodomorphs
        (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).[21]<br /><br />

        Birds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod
        dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class
        that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority
        of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional
        style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires
        that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must
        be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs
        and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.[22] Birds are classified as belonging
        to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which
        are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.[23]<br /><br />

        Research by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017
        suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis
        by Baron et al. recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the Theropoda
        than the Sauropodomorpha, as opposed to the traditional union of theropods
        with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida to refer to
        the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined
        as the last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus, Diplodocus
        carnegii, and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain
        included as dinosaurs.[24][25]

        General description
    </h2>
    <p>
        Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as
        archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body.[26] Many prehistoric
        animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs,
        mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and pelycosaurs (especially Dimetrodon),
        but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect
        hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs.[27] Dinosaurs were the
        dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic
        and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and
        niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a domestic cat,
        and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.[28]<br /><br />

        Dinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animals; according
        to a 2006 study, over 500 non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified
        with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the
        fossil record has been estimated at around 1850, nearly 75% of which remain
        to be discovered.[10] An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur
        genera existed, including many that would not have been preserved in the
        fossil record.[29] By September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of
        dinosaurs had been named.[11]<br /><br />

        In 2016, the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the
        Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468.[30][31] Some are herbivorous,
        others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and
        omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds),
        some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Anchisaurus
        and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial
        modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and
        some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many
        Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally
        small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that
        they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period.[12]
        Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and
        there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly
        or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semiaquatic habits.[32]
